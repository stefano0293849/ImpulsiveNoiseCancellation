# ImpulsiveNoiseCancellation
This respository is born thanks to the cooperation between three students attending the Master degree in Electronic Engineering in the University of Udine. The aim of the project is to study and provide solutions able to reduce a loud and brief sound like the sound generated from a firearm.

In order to do that, we have provided 3 different implementation

1) zero clipping
2) old data clipping
3) compression


In the zero clipping, we aim to reconstrung the missing datas with the autoregressive model (ARIMA)

all the infos are on our website: http://impulsivenoise.altervista.org/
