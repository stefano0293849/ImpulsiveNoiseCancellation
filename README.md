# ImpulsiveNoiseCancellation
This respository is born thanks to the cooperation between three students attending the Master degree in Electronic Engineering in the University of Udine. The aim of the project is to study and provide solutions able to reduce a loud and brief sound like the sound generated from a firearm while instead managing to hear the voice.

In order to do that, we have provided 4 different implementations

1) zero clipping
2) old data clipping
3) compression
4) FxLMS real time implementation


In the zero clipping, we aim to reconstrunct the missing datas with the autoregressive model (ARIMA) or interpolating the data with a polynomial function .
